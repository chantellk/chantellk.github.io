<h2>Project 2: GitHub User and Project Pages</h2>

<p>In this project, I learned how to create GitHub User and Github project pages. I learned what the differences are, and how making such pages is basically a computer science resume portfolio. In this project I learned how to style and add content to the pages, and I what to use Readme.md files for.</p>
